# OurSay Voting App
Our team will be developing a web application that will be used at the Junior Design Exposition. It will be usable on any device, such as phone, table, laptop, and etc. The app's purpose is to log votes from students at the Junior Design Exposition, in order to determine the expositionâ€™s winner. It will be a full-stack project, using the MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS).

# Install Guide

## Prerequisites
### - Customer must have a computer that can process the newest react code and can install and run Visual Studio code
### - The github repository must be cloned locally and opened in VS code

## Dependent Libraries
### - Node.js must be installed through VS code by running the command "npm install" in the client folder

## Download Instructions
### - In order for customer to gain access to project, it must be run locally or deployed live
### - In order for users to gain access to the project, the application must be deployed live on a server site like Heroku

## Run Instructions
### - Once Node.js has been installed run "npm start" to run the application locally
### - Once application is running, there is nothing left to install

## Troubleshooting
### - Sometimes npm install will give you all kinds of errors, so run "npm install --force" to force npm to install and ignore the warnings
### - If npm is not starting, make sure you are cd into the client folder of the repository or run "npm install" again


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
